## Project Structure

* Project presentation document: **AusWeather.pdf**.  
* **data** folder contains the project data sets and trained model file. 
* **source** folder contains the script that generates the report.
* **shiny** folder includes the source code of the shiny app.

To run the project code:

* set the working directory to *./source*
* open *main.Rmd*. Please make sure that you install all required packages; they are listed at the beginning of the script. It is assumed that all R Markdown dependencies are satisfied, including the libraries that do conversion to the *PDF* format. Execute the script. **Note: it takes about an hour to execute the script**. It is possible to reduce the execution time changing the *SampleSize* value in the script to 3000, 4000 records. Do not go below 3K; some algorithms might not converge!
